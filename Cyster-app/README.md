# CYSTER
An application built for detecting PCOS and providing easily available remedies using machine learning and Flask framework during Tech for Good Hackathon by Shooting Stars Foundation and NETSCOUT.

It helps in diagnosing PCOS in early stages by asking a set of questions ranging from weight and height to duration of menstural cycyles. 
The topic was selected as it is a very critical ailment and a lot of women in our country are going through this without seeking proper medical help. 
More than fifty percent of PCOS cases worldwide remain undiagnosed and in some cases it even leads to cancer.
